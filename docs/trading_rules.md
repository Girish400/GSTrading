# Trading Rules

This Markdown document is a structured conversion of [trading_rules.docx](C:\Users\Girish\Desktop\CodexTrading\trading_rules.docx). The original 100 checklist items are preserved, but reorganized into practical operating categories so they are easier to review, implement, and test.

## Categorization Model

- `Window and Trigger Timing`: when a setup is allowed to activate
- `Opening Imbalance`: opening spread and size-based setup filters
- `ORB Setup`: one-minute opening range breakout requirements
- `Momentum Setup`: fast-tape momentum qualification
- `Market Context`: index, breadth, sector, and volatility alignment
- `Liquidity and Participation`: volume, ATR, spread, and tape quality
- `Technical Alignment`: trend, VWAP, MACD, RSI, and candle structure checks
- `Entry Confirmation and Location`: confirmation tick and price-location rules
- `Catalyst and Event Filters`: news, earnings, macro, and halt exclusions
- `Risk and Trade Management`: sizing, stops, targets, position caps, cooldowns, and journaling

## 1. Window and Trigger Timing

- `Rule 1`: Execute only between `06:30:00-06:30:59 PST`
- `Rule 6`: ORB executes only between `06:31:00-06:31:02 PST`
- `Rule 72`: Avoid all trades between `11:00 AM-1:00 PM EST`

## 2. Opening Imbalance

- `Rule 2`: Bid-ask spread must be `<= $0.03`
- `Rule 3`: Ask size `>= 50,000` is a bullish signal

- `Rule 99`: All entries must be limit orders
- `Rule 100`: Every trade must be logged with entry, exit, triggered rules, and outcome

## Implementation Priority

If these rules are implemented as software, the practical build order should be:

1. `Window and Trigger Timing`
2. `Opening Imbalance`, `ORB Setup`, and `Momentum Setup`
3. `Liquidity and Participation`
4. `Market Context`
5. `Technical Alignment`
6. `Entry Confirmation and Location`
7. `Catalyst and Event Filters`
8. `Risk and Trade Management`

## Notes for Engineering

- Several rules depend on data not currently provided by the basic `ibapi` market-data stream alone, including breadth, sector confirmation, VIX, ATR, RSI, MACD, economic calendar events, and earnings schedules.
- Rules `33-38`, `82-83`, `90-98`, and `100` imply additional services for market context, event data, and trade journaling.
- This document should be treated as the readable reference, while `trading_rules.docx` remains the original source artifact.
